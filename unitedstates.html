    <h1> CENSORSHIP </h1> "And when memory failed and written records were falsified—when that happened, the claim of the Party to have improved the conditions of human life had got to be accepted, because there did not exist, and never again could exist, any standard against which it could be tested."

     In the modern day of the United States, the government is actively trying to rewrite history by censoring the literature and history that children learn in the classroom. "In conjunction with attempts to restrict teaching about racism and equity, DeSantis also signed the “Don’t Say Gay” law, known formally as the Parental Rights in Education bill, that limits discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity within public schools for K–3 students. These restrictions have forced many teachers and librarians to remove certain books discussing these topics and to enforce stricter guidelines on what students should and should not be allowed to read. Specifically, Florida mandates librarians go through training to avoid selecting books and instructional materials that violate any of these laws, and to “err on the side of caution” while making their selections." By banning children from learning about sexual orientation and sexuality, the government can rewrite history by denying the historical existance of queer people. Furthermore, it keeps them naive and prone to manipulation. This is similar to how the government of Oceania erases people who commit thoughtcrime from history, and makes false statements about what inventions were made by the government. The government of Florida has gone even further by banning the teaching of race. "HB 7, formally called the "Individual Freedom" measure, bans educators from teaching certain topics related to race and is designed, in part, to prevent teachers from making students feel guilt or shame about their race because of historical events." This is an example of how the government erases history, by denying racism. Even though the United States as a racist history, the children won't learn about it because the government is banning teaching of any literature that pertains to racism. This is a perfect parallel to the dystopian world of 1984. <br>
