    <h1> SURVEILLANCE </h1> "There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. How often, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork. It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time. But at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to. You had to live—did live, from habit that became instinct—in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized" (4).

     Much like the fictional country of Oceania in the book 1984, modern day Russia has a precedent surveiling its citizens and monitoring their movements. For instance, "When Yekaterina Maksimova can’t afford to be late, the journalist and activist avoids taking the Moscow subway, even though it’s probably the most efficient route.
That’s because she’s been detained five times in the past year, thanks to the system’s pervasive security cameras with facial recognition. She says police would tell her the cameras “reacted” to her — although they often seemed not to understand why, and would let her go after a few hours." This is example of how Russia will detain citizens and keep track of their routine. Much like the Thought Police, the Russian police force can detain citizens for simply looking wrong or suspicious. <br>

    <h1> THOUGHTCRIME </h1> "To know and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions which canceled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them, to use logic against logic, to repudiate morality while laying claim to it, to believe that democracy was impossible and that the Party was the guardian of democracy, to forget whatever it was necessary to forget, then to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed, and then promptly to forget it again: and above all, to apply the same process to the process itself. That was the ultimate subtlety: consciously to induce unconsciousness, and then, once again, to become unconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just performed. Even to understand the word ‘doublethink’ involved the use of doublethink." (39-40).

     Furthermore, the Russia police also indulges in policies that resemble the concept of thoughtcrime. "More importantly, the principle of law enforcement was changed: instead of reacting to threats, the authorities emphasized prevention. The Interior Minister then announced that “the function of the department on countering extremism is first of all operative and recruiting work, aimed at the discovery and suppression of crimes, and also the prevention and monitoring of what is going on in the sphere of extremist activities.” But how does one prevent a crime which has not yet taken place? The answer was obvious for the Medvedev administration: by compiling lists of potential troublemakers." Just like the Thought Police, the Russian policeforce also takes a preventative measure to fighting crime by punishing people for being potentially able to commit a crime. <br> Source: https://cepa.org/article/russias-surveillance-state/
